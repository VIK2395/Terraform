- Do not edit state directly, only via terraform commands
- Use shared remote storage for state
- Use state locking to prevent cuncurrent updates. This can be done on remote backend storage like S3 bucket. Not all backend storages support locking!
  - TF automatically will lock state file?
- Backup state file. Enable versioning for this
- 1 dedicated state file per environment
- Host TF code in own git repo
- CI for terraform code. Test env. PR reviews.
- Apply infrastructure changes only via CD pipeline

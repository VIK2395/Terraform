Terraform and AWS CLI are both tools used to manage AWS resources, but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways.

- Terraform
  - A **declarative Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** tool.
  - You describe the desired state of your infrastructure in configuration files, and Terraform ensures your AWS resources match that state.
  - Terraform tracks the state of your infrastructure in a state file.
- AWS CLI
  - A command-line interface for interacting with AWS services.
  - Used for executing specific **imperative commands** to manage AWS resources (e.g., create an S3 bucket, start an EC2 instance).
  - No concept of maintaining state - each command operates independently.
